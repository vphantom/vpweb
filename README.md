# Vanilla+

**WARNING: PROOF OF CONCEPT ONLY!**  An eventual version 1.0 is expected by 2023.  This is a back-burner project for me as of 2022.

Vanilla+ is a minimalistic web interface development library.  It adds no abstraction layers and thus allows you to use only the portions you need without bloat from the rest.  It is divided in 3 main parts:

* A basic CSS library
* A JS library
* A collection of web components

The components make use of the JS library and aim to be otherwise stand-alone.  They don't even depend on the CSS library, which only serves to theme them.  When possible, components are meant to be progressive enhancements.

### Installation

```sh
npm install vpweb
```

## CSS Framework

See documentation in `docs/css.html`.

## JS Library

The minimalistic library aims to make "Vanilla JS" development more expressive without masking the native objects or impeding run-time performance.  More specifically:

- 100% compatible with plain JS, every function is independently opt-in
- Compatibility down to Chrome/Edge/Opera 79, Safari 12, Firefox 78
- Abstract away boilerplate, alias frequently used long-named symbols
- Cooperate with tree-shaking bundlers
- Tiny: stay **under 4KB minified** (not compressed)

Specifically avoided are:

- To wrap native objects (i.e. `HTMLElement`)
- To alias or wrap the entire DOM API
- Other development comforts which would cost run-time overhead (i.e. a universal `$()`)

### Stdlib

Usage: `import { ... } from 'vpweb/stdlib';`

TODO: JSDoc

### Browser

Usage: `import { ... } from 'vpweb/browser';`

TODO: JSDoc

## All Components

If you want to use the whole thing in one line:

```js
// Option 1 (recommended): include in your build.
// No configuration options
import 'vpweb/vpweb';
```

```html
<!-- Option 2: load as stand-alone script -->
<script src="dist/vpweb.min.js"></script>
```

## Fast Clicks

Activate clicks on `mousedown` to save at least ~100ms in response times.

```js
// Option 1 (recommended): include in your build.
// No configuration options
import 'vpweb/fast';
```

```html
<!-- Option 2: load as stand-alone script -->
<script src="dist/fast.min.js"></script>
```

* Anchors in a block with the `vp-fast` attribute or with the attribute directly are triggered on `mousedown` instead of the browser's `mouseup`.  Limited to anchors with `href` to avoid side effects from the `click` event triggering twice.

* Submit inputs/buttons with `vp-fast` attribute, or in forms with `vp-fast`, trigger on `mousedown`.  Limited to `[type=submit]` because of the double `click` triggering.

## Forms

Submit forms as a JSON POST and replace part of the DOM with the HTML response.

```js
// Option 1 (recommended): include in your build.
// No configuration options
import 'vpweb/forms';
```

```html
<!-- Option 2: load as stand-alone script -->
<script src="dist/forms.min.js"></script>
```

Notes:

* Submitting the form ignores subsequent submissions within the next second to help avoid double clicks a.k.a. "bounces" (from users and `vp-fast`).

* Currently ignores the `formaction` attribute on submit buttons.

### JSON Encoding

Activated by `<form method="vp-json">`

Names with `[]` suffix have that suffix stripped and are accumulated as arrays.  Without the suffix, only one value for each name is stored.

Inside the form, elements with attribute `vp-widget` and properties `vpName` and `vpValue` are treated as inputs.  If `vpValue` is a function, it is called and its result stored.  Since we're serializing to JSON, objects and arrays are allowed in addition to scalars.

### Response Display

Activated by `<form vp-target="selector">`

Available only with JSON forms above, if this selector is specified and found, its content will be replaced with the POST's response.  With invalid selector or without `vp-target` at all, the whole page's body will be replaced.  If the result is `<html>`, only the contents of its `<body>` will be used.

## Editeur

Viewer and optionally editor for arbitrary JSON blobs.

```js
// Option 1 (recommended): include in your build.
// No configuration options
import 'vpweb/editeur';
```

```html
<!-- Option 2: load as stand-alone script -->
<script src="dist/editeur.min.js"></script>
```

Example usage:

```html
<form method="vp-json">
  <vp-editeur
    vp-schema="schema_name"
    vp-data="data_name"
    vp-name="form_field_name"
  ></vp-editeur>
  <script type="application/json" vp-editeur-schema="schema_name"></script>
  <script type="application/json" vp-editeur-data="data_name"></script>
</form>
```

The optional JSON scripts may be inline or referenced with `src`, in which case they will be loaded asynchronously.  Without `vp-name` is read-only mode, in which case `<form>` is not necessary.  At least one of `vp-schema` or `vp-data` must be specified in order to display anything.  Attributes:

* **`vp-schema`** Name of schema definition to apply (optional)
* **`vp-data`** Name of data content to use (optional)
* **`vp-name`** Name of form field to represent (optional)

In editor mode, the `<vp-editeur>` has Promeneur-friendly properties `vpName` and `vpValue`.  The component uses a shadow DOM so its content do not interfere with regular forms.

### Schema

Using a schema is useful to customize the display and to allow starting without data.  A schema is a JSON object with one key for each root-level key of the JSON data it overlays.  Each key is an object with the following possible keys, all optional:

* **`__schema`** For objects or lists of objects, schema of the contained object(s)
* **`sort`** Number or string to use as field sorting key. (default: scalars, then objects, then arrays)
* **`label`** Localized string, HTML allowed but not recommended (default: property key)
* **`tooltip`** Localized string, HTML not allowed (default: property key)
* **`combo`** Identifier of list to use as a `<datalist>` (see below)
* **`repeatable`** This key should be a list, not a scalar/object (default: `false`)
* **`type`** For scalars, one of: `boolean`, `number`, `string`, `textarea` (default: `string`)

At the root level only, an additional `__lists` key may be set with an object defining various lists.  Each item is a value followed by its localized label.

Example:

```json
{
  "__lists": {
    "list1": {
      "val1": "Label One",
      ...
    }
  },
  "key_one": {
    "label": "First Key",
    "tooltip": "This field contains something",
    "sort": 23,
    "combo": "list1"
  },
  ...
}
```
