# Vanilla+

<!-- [![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/vphantom/vpweb.svg?style=plastic)]() -->

Vanilla+ is a minimalistic web interface development library.  It adds no abstraction layers and thus allows you to use only the portions you need without bloat from the rest.  It is divided in 3 main parts:

* A basic CSS library
* A JS library
* A collection of web components

The components make use of the JS library and aim to be otherwise stand-alone.  They don't even depend on the CSS library, which only serves to theme them.  When possible, components are meant to be progressive enhancements.

### Status

**WORKING PROTOTYPE** "It works for me." The APIs may still change significantly, bugs and browser incompatibilities may still abound.

A stable version 1.0 is expected by the end of 2024.

See [TODO](TODO.md) for details of what's coming up.

### Installation

```sh
npm install vpweb
```

## CSS FRAMEWORK

Main objectives:

- Responsive, but with **desktop as a first-class citizen**
- Nearly pure CSS, using JS only where it helps significantly
- Usable as a package or as a set of SCSS include files
- Unique selectors to minimize conflicts with other frameworks
- Forego advanced concepts in favor of small size and high performance

Documentation: `docs/css.html`

## JS LIBRARY

**Docs:** [Stdlib](docs/stdlib.md) | [Browser](docs/browser.md)

The minimalistic library aims to make "Vanilla JS" development more expressive without masking the native objects or impeding run-time performance.  More specifically:

- 100% compatible with plain JS, every function is independently opt-in
- Compatibility down to Chrome/Edge/Opera 79, Safari 12, Firefox 78
- Abstract away boilerplate, alias frequently used long-named symbols
- Cooperate with tree-shaking bundlers
- Tiny: stay **under 4KB minified** (not compressed)

Specifically avoided are:

- To wrap native objects (i.e. `HTMLElement`)
- To alias or wrap the entire DOM API
- Other development comforts which would cost run-time overhead (i.e. a universal `$()`)

## COMPONENTS

**Docs:** [Editeur](docs/editeur.md) | [Fast Clicks](docs/fast.md) | [Forms](docs/forms.md)

If you want to use the whole thing in one line without need to activate manually on shadowed elements:

```js
// Option 1 (recommended): include in your build.
// No configuration options
import 'vpweb/vpweb';
```

```html
<!-- Option 2: load as stand-alone script -->
<script src="dist/vpweb.min.js"></script>
```

You may also use individual components, although if you use more than one as stand-alone scripts, there will be some redundancy.

Note that components triggered by attributes or class names cannot self-activate inside shadow DOMs.  If you want to use Vanilla+ components inside those, you'll need to activate them manually (for example, with `fast.preclick(element)`).  See each component's documentation for manual activation usage.
