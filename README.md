Vanilla+ is a minimalistic web interface development library.  It adds no abstraction layers and thus allows you to use only the portions you need without bloat from the rest.  It is divided in 3 main parts:

* A basic CSS framework
* A JS library
* A collection of web components

The components make use of the library and aim to be otherwise stand-alone, triggered by CSS classes, custom HTML attributes and tags.  Whenever possible, they are meant to be progressive enhancements.


**CURRENTLY IN EARLY STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT!**

## CSS Framework

See documentation in `docs/css.html`.

## Library

The minimalistic library aims to make "Vanilla JS" development more expressive without masking the native objects or impeding run-time performance.  More specifically:

- 100% compatible with plain JS, every function is independently opt-in
- Compatibility down to Chrome/Edge/Opera 80, Safari 12, Firefox 78
- Abstract away boilerplate and alias frequently used long-named symbols
- Cooperate with tree-shaking bundlers
- Tiny: stay under 4KB minified non-compressed

Specifically avoided are:

- To alias or wrap the entire DOM API
- Developer comforts which would incur run-time overhead (i.e. a `$()`)

### Stdlib

Usage: `import { ... } from 'vpweb/stdlib';`

TODO: JSDoc

### Browser

Usage: `import { ... } from 'vpweb/browser';`

TODO: JSDoc

## Promeneur

I/O kernel for web sites.

**Usage:** `import 'vpweb/promeneur';`

**Self-contained:** `<script src="dist/promeneur.min.js"></script>`

### Attribute `vp-fast`

* Anchors in a block with the `vp-fast` attribute or with the attribute directly are triggered on `mousedown` instead of the browser's `mouseup`, saving ~100ms.  Limited to anchors with `href` to avoid side effects from the `click` event triggering twice.

* Submit inputs/buttons with `vp-fast` attribute, or in forms with `vp-fast`, trigger on `mousedown`.  Limited to `[type=submit]` because of the double `click` triggering.

### Form method `vp-json`, attribute `vp-target`

* When submitting, encodes form data as JSON, sent in a POST request with appropriate MIME type.

* Names with `[]` suffix have that suffix stripped and are accumulated as arrays.  (Without the suffix, a name found multiple times would only encode one of the values.)

* Elements with JS property `vpName` will not have their children crawled.  Instead, their `vpValue` property will be used: if it is a function, it will be called and its result stored, otherwise it will be used directly.

* If `vp-target` is specified and found, its content will be replaced with the POST's response.  If the result is `<html>`, only the contents of its `<body>` will be used.  With invalid or no target, the current page's `<title>` and `<body>` will be replaced with the POST response's.

## Editeur

Viewer and optionally editor for arbitrary JSON blobs.

**Usage:** `import 'vpweb/editeur';`

**Self-contained:** `<script src="dist/editeur.min.js"></script>`

Watches for `<script>` tags with `[type="application/json"]` and either `vp-view` or `vp-edit` attributes, to view or edit respectively.  Inserts a `<vp-editeur>` block immediately before each such script.

In editor mode, the `vp-edit` attribute specifies the form variable name it represents.

TODO: optional schema for I18N labels, select choices, etc.

## DateRange

Upgrades a pair of date selection inputs into a date range widget, complete with shortcuts to change by various increments (i.e. weekly, monthly, quarterly).

**Usage:** `import 'vpweb/daterange';`

**Self-contained:** `<script src="dist/daterange.min.js"></script>`

Wrap any pair of `<input type="date">` inside a `<div _daterange="true">` or a `<date-range>` block.  Any other mark-up inside that block will be removed.  The first input will be used as the beginning date, and the second input as the end date.

The component monitors the DOM for changes and handles new blocks added dynamically to the page.  The input names are preserved, so the form data is unaffected.
